# Modals
Some slash commands may prompt you to fill out a custom menu called a modal. Commands that do that will have the <span class="label label-pink">Modal</span> label.

## Creating and Updating polls

Creating and updating a poll will respond with a modal. If the ``Image URL`` field has a value that is not a url to a valid PNG your poll will fail to load.
