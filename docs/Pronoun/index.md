# Pronouns

CatCore's Pronouns feature is designed to full user customization, including using neo-pronouns not available in many pronoun bots. Because adding hundreds of roles for countless neopronouns used by members was not very feasible CatCore stores user pronouns in a database and allows users to see them by running [slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ).

## Pronoun Add 
{: .d-inline-block }

Slash Command
{: .label .label-green }

```xml
/pronoun add <pronoun> 
```
This command adds an already created pronoun to your user profile, to use it type ``/pronoun add`` in the message bar and use the autocompletion to select a pronoun.
